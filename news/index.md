<p>20 October 2007 - OpenMeca</p>

<img src="/images/news/openmeca.gif" style="width=100px">   The open-source mechanical simulation software [OpenMeca](http://openmeca.fr.nf/) has been recently released. This software, based on Chrono::Engine, is aimed at teaching and researching kinematics using a 3D interactive view. OpenMeca is free and based on the GPL license.

<p>30 August 2007 - Ebmedded Bullet collision detection engine</p>

<img src="/images/news/bullet.gif" style="width=100px">    The collision engine of Chrono::Engine has been updated to the most recent version the [Bullet](http://www.bulletphysics.com) collision detection library. The Bullet library features advanced and robust algorithms for fast collision detection.\
NOTE 1: in Chrono::Engine, only the collision detection features of the Bullet library are used, since we use the Chrono::Egine custom methods for all the rest (physics, etc.).\
NOTE 2: since the Bullet library is embedded in the Chrono::Engine library, you do not need to download and install Bullet - it is completely wrapped inside Chrono::Engine, and you do not need to know anything about it (just keep on using the same C++ functions that you used with the previous releases).
</div>
<div class = "well">
<p>13 July 2007 - New Chrono::Engine release v.0.1.9.</p>

<img src="/images/news/chronoengine_clock_small.jpg" style="width=100px">   The new release v.0.1.9 can be downloaded from this site. It fixes some compatibility issues with the latest Irrlicht 1.3.1 libraries. The previous Chrono::Engine SDK was compatible only with Irrlicht 1.3. From this release, we support Irrlicht v1.3.1 or superior. Note that the Irrlicht library is needed only for compiling the demos with 3D realtime views. NOTE!!! this 0.1.9 release replaces the 0.1.8 of two days ago, because we updated the installer and the makefiles, so it can be installed also in paths containing spaces, ex: "C:\\Program files\\chronoengine".

<p>25 June 2007 - ECCOMAS conference on Multibody</p>

<img src="/images/news/milano.jpg" style="width=100px">   The Chrono::Engine middleware has been presented at the [Multibody Dynamics 2007](http://www.multibody2007.org) ECCOMAS international conference, in Milano (25-28 June 2007). More than 200 researchers meet at the conference and presented recent theorethical developements and applications of multibody dynamics. Among these, also Chrono::Engine simulations, software architecture and mathematical foundations were presented.

<p>28 August - Run-time executables</p>

<img src="/images/news/executable.jpg" style="width=100px">   We are developing run-time executables showing the Chrono::Engine in action. These interactive demos will be available soon on this site, as soon as the first beta release of the SDK will be published.\
In the SDK you will find the corresponding C++ source code to generate each example, and the corresponding tutorial.
</div>
<div class = "well">
<p>27 July - Integration tools for IRRLICHT</p>

<img src="/images/news/irrlicht.png" style="width=100px">   We choose [IRRLICHT](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/features.html) as our 'official' realtime 3D engine. The free and powerful Irrlicht library offers a clean and easy-to-use C++ API, it is platform independent and uses either OpenGL or DirectX, so we adopted it as the default way of showing Chrono::Engine simulations in realtime 3D views.\
Note that other 3D engines can be used as well, such as OGRE or DirectX, but the source code for examples provided in Chrono::Engine will use Irrlicht.\
To allow rapid developement of application based on Chrono::Engine + Irrlicht, we provide also some utility C++ classes.

<p>7 June 2006 - Porting on Visual C++ 2005</p>

<img src="/images/news/visualstudio.jpg" style="width=100px">   The CHRONO::ENGINE has been successfully passsed the compatibility test for the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005. The Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 compiler, in the 'Express' edition, can be downloaded for free. (The Express edition replaces the older 'Visual Toolkit 2003' free compiler: it has less limitations and also includes the IDE). Note: to use the Visual C++ 2005, you must also install the Microsoft Platform SDK (also free) because some libraries are needed by Chrono::Engine.

<p>4 May 2006 - Chrono::Engine official logo</p>

<img src="/images/news/chronoengine_clock_small.jpg" style="width=100px">   The official logo for Chrono::Engine has been designed (it is a 'Chrono::Engine' string surrounded by two stylized rings). Also, an official 'demo picture' has been created with the Realsoft3D rendering software: it represents the inner mechanisms of a clock (somewhat inspired to the complex movement of a real Vacheron-Constantin clock). This raytraced picture will be used for flyers, web site, etc.

<p>15 March 2006 - Porting on GNU C++ (MingW)</p>

<img src="/images/news/gnu-head.jpg" style="width=100px">   The CHRONO::ENGINE has been successfully passsed the compatibility test for the GNU C++ compiler (MingW distribution). Heretofore, the multibody engine now includes also a dynamic library for people which want to link it using in projects based on the MingW compiler.
