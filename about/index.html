		<p>The first version of the Chrono::Engine software, once simply called Chrono, had been developed in 1998 by [http://dynamics.eng.unipr.it/tasora Prof. Alessandro Tasora] when he was a student at the Politecnico di Milano. It was the result of a thesis in Mechanical Engineering. Originally, Chrono::Engine was meant as a multibody tool for robotics and biomechanics.</p>
		<p>	Soon after the thesis, Alessandro Tasora started working at the Politecnico di Milano as a researcher and he kept improving the software, which was used in designing mechatronic devices and robots. In those years, the software was closed source and it was not available to the public.</p>
		<p>	Until 2002, the Chrono::Engine software was tightly connected to an user interface, in form of a plug-in for the Realsoft3D modeler; this lead also to commercial licenses with an user-friendly GUI interface. However it soon emerged that a development of Chrono::Engine in form of a stand-alone library would have been more versatile and open to future developments, so in years 2002-2005 it took the shape of a middleware, as it is nowadays.</p>
		<p>	In year 2005, [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~anitescu/ Prof. Mihai Anitescu] from Argonne Natonal Laboratories started a collaboration that led to advanced solvers for the case of frictional contacts - a problem that is challenging even nowadays for many simulation tools.</p>
		<p>	In year 2006, [http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~negrut/index.htm Prof. Dan Negrut] from the University of Wisconsin joined the team and started an intense collaboration that led to many applications and that made Chrono::Engine much more widespread. In particular, Prof. Dan Negrut fostered the development of the GPU version of the code, and had many of his students at his [http://sbel.wisc.edu SBEL] laboratories working on Chrono::Engine, obtaining media exposure and scientific prizes. Also, in 2008 the NVIDIA corporation started sponsoring the researches on parallel numerical methods for our massive multibody problems.</p>
		<p>	In year 2013 we took the decision to release the Chrono::Engine as open source, with a very liberal BSD license, and we made the code freely available on [http://github.com/projectchrono GIThub]. We also decided that Chrono::Engine should be a component in the broader context of the new ProjectChrono ecosystem.</p>

		<p>
			Currently, the <a href="/people">development team</a> counts many programmers and scientists, and there are many institutions and companies that used and are actively using Chrono::Engine for researches and engineering applications.</p>

			<p>Future developments will address CFD (we already have experimental code not available on Github), flexible parts via corotational FEM and ANCF, and new efficient solvers. </p>
