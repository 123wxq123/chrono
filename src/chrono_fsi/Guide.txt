1 - several cares need to be taken regarding chronoVehicle:
you have to copy your body.obj, and its poseray .inc files into chrono-vehicle/data/hmmwv folder. For instance, myHumvee1.obj, myHumvee1_POV_geom.inc, and myHumvee1_POV_mat.inc
Then, you need to modify vehicle json file in /vehicle folder, to call the approapriate obj files. Basically you need to modify the last two lines. If you are using lugged wheel, you have to modify the json file associated with lugged (or create new, then call it in your code): for instance myHMMWV_lugged.json needs to define visualization like this on the buttom.

  "Visualization":
  {
    "Mesh Filename":  "hmmwv/myHumvee1.obj",
    "Mesh Name":      "myHumvee1_POV_geom"
  }

if you are using cylindrical, you can use myHMMWV.json. The aforementioned json files are for simple vehicle model. the other files are for more sophisticated vehicle models 


2 - when initializing from file, make sure to set time_hold_vehicle in fsi_hmmwv_params.h to 0, and bool initializeFluidFromFile = true;

3 - if using older params files, you need to add two tweak values after all other parameters in checkPointParameters.txt. previously, I did not have tweak values and they where constant inside the code
