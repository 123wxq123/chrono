Export POVray animations (demo_postprocess.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_postprocess}
==========================


Tutorial that teaches how to use the 
[POSTPROCESSING module](@ref module_postprocessing_installation)
to create animations with [POVray](http://www.povray.org). 

When the simulation is run, a set of .pov and .ini files 
are saved on disk, so that one can use POVray 
later to do high-quality rendering of simulations.

- Learn how to attach ChAsset shapes to rigid bodies.
- Learn how to output data for POVray. 

Note: the same assets can be used to render animations 
in real-time in the interactive 3D view of Irrlicht, 
as explained in demo_irr_assets.cpp

\include demo_postprocess.cpp
